# Technical Overview

This application is a Angular-based web application that runs in the user's web browser. It provides the following key features:

User Authentication: Upon logging in, the application creates and stores tokens locally on the user's machine to maintain user sessions securely.

Backend Server: The application is powered by a Spring Boot server, handling various user requests and seamlessly interacting with a PostgreSQL database. This server ensures efficient functionality and persistent data storage, providing a robust foundation for the application's backend operations.

With these components working together, the application delivers a secure and feature-rich experience to its users.
